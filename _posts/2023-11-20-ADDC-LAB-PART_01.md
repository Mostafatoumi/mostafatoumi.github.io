# Setting Up a Windows Server for Penetration Testing with Active Directory

## 1. Introduction
### Overview of the blog's purpose

Welcome to the Active Directory Pentesting Blog, your ultimate guide for constructing a robust and secure Windows Server environment crafted specifically for penetration testing. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced professional, this blog aims to offer a comprehensive guide to help you build your own penetration testing lab

### Importance of a controlled environment for penetration testing
In the realm of cybersecurity, the significance of a controlled environment for penetration testing cannot be overstated. A controlled environment provides a safe and isolated space where ethical hackers, security professionals, and enthusiasts can simulate real-world cyber threats without compromising the integrity of live systems. Here's why it matters:

* Risk Mitigation:

Enables safe exploration without the risk of damaging live systems.
* Realistic Scenarios:

Mimics real-world conditions, providing a close-to-reality testing environment.
* Skill Development:

Offers a hands-on learning ground for system administration, network security, and ethical hacking.
* Confidentiality and Compliance:

Protects sensitive data, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
* Iterative Testing:

Facilitates continuous improvement by refining strategies based on test outcomes.
* Ethical Practices:

Promotes ethical and responsible hacking, emphasizing constructive use of hacking skills.

## 2. Lab Setup
### Hardware and software requirements.

To establish a robust penetration testing lab with Windows Server 2012 as the Active Directory Domain Controller (AD DC) server, Windows 10 as the client machine, and Kali Linux for attacking, ensure your hardware and software meet the following requirements:

### Hardware Requirements:

* Server Machine (Windows Server 2012 r2):

`Processor`: Dual-core processor or higher.

`RAM`: 2 GB or more.

`Storage`: 50 GB or more for the operating system and additional space for virtual machines.

* Client Machine (Windows 10):

`Processor`: Dual-core processor or higher.

`RAM`: 2 GB or more.

`Storage`: 30 GB or more for the operating system and applications.

* Attacking Machine (Kali Linux):

`Processor`: Dual-core processor or higher.

`RAM`: 4 GB or more.
`Storage`: 30 GB or more for the operating system and tools.


### Software Requirements:

* Windows Server 2012 R2 : 

You can Download ISO of windows SERVER 2012 r1 from  [here](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-windows-server-2012-R2.html?lcid=fr) 

* Windows 10:

You can Download windowd 10 from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/fr-fr/software-download/windows10) 

* Kali Linux:

Choose any OS for penetration testing; I recommend using [Kali linux](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-installer-images)  for optimal results.


### Virtualization Platform:

Choose a virtualization platform like [VMware Workstation Pro](https://www.vmware.com/fr/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html) or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) for creating and managing virtual machines.
