## Overview :

In this blog, we'll embark on a journey into the world of LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) and Active Directory. But here's the twist – no pre-existing tools like `ldapsearch`, `ldapmodify`, `impacket`, or `bloodhound` will be our guide. Instead, we'll roll up our sleeves and create a simple yet powerful tool using `Python3` and `ldap3`.

### Why create our tool?

Because understanding the mechanics behind the tools we use is essential. Many cybersecurity enthusiasts jump straight into using tools without unraveling the magic behind them. This blog aims to demystify the process, empowering you to interact with LDAP directly and comprehend the intricacies of `Active Directory enumeration`, `information retrieval`, and `object modification`.

### What's on the agenda? 

We'll cover everything from establishing a connection to Active Directory using ldap3, searching for users and groups, to modifying and adding objects like a pro. By the end, you'll not only grasp how these operations are performed but also be equipped to create your own `LDAP-interacting` tools from scratch.

So, buckle up as we dive into the realm of LDAP and Active Directory, where you'll emerge with the skills to navigate and manipulate directories with confidence. Let's begin this journey, empowering you to be the master of your tools and the architect of your cybersecurity strategies.


## Introduction to ldap3 :


`ldap3` is a Python library for interacting with LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) servers. It provides a convenient and Pythonic way to perform LDAP operations, such as `querying`, `adding`, `modifying`, and `deleting entries` in LDAP directories.

### Installation :

You can download and install `ldap3` directly from its GitHub source :

[https://github.com/cannatag/ldap3](https://github.com/cannatag/ldap3)

and then 
```bash
python setup.py install
```

Or install the ldap3 library directly from pyPI:

```bash
pip3 install ldap3
```

## Active directory Environment :

Assuming you've installed Windows Server and configured Active Directory, ensure LDAP access is set up. If you're unfamiliar with this process, refer to my previous post, [Active Directory Mastery - A Guide to Windows Server Setup for Penetration Testing.](https://mostafatoumi.github.io/posts/ADDC-LAB-PART_01/) Once your environment is ready, let's Connecting to Active Directory with Python and ldap3

## Connecting to Active Directory with Python and ldap3 :

### Importing Object 

we need to imports 3 specific components from the `ldap3` module:

`Server:` Represents an LDAP server like `ldap://ex.example.com`

`Connection:` Represents a connection to an LDAP server.

`SAFE_SYNC:` Represents a synchronous (blocking) connection mode with safety checks.
`ALL:` To retrieve all info about entries

```bash
from ldap3 import Server, Connection, ALL
```

Now, we've imported the essential namespaces, `Server` and `Connection`. In the `LDAP` protocol, authentication is referred to as `Bind` which I explained in my [LDAP](https://mostafatoumi.github.io/posts/LDAP/) post. You can refer to it for more details. In LDAP, there are three types of Bind connections: `Anonymous Bind`, `Simple Password Bind`, and `SASL`. 

Let's start with the anonymous bind

### Anonymous Bind :

Let’s start accessing the server with an anonymous bind:

```bash
>>> from ldap3 import Server, Connection, ALL
>>> srv = Server("emsec.emsec.htb")
>>> conn = Connection(srv, auto_bind=True)

```
so if we Displays information about the connection object, showing details like server host, port, authentication method, etc.

```bash
>>> conn
Connection(server=Server(host='emsec.emsec.htb', port=389, use_ssl=False, allowed_referral_hosts=[('*', True)], get_info='SCHEMA', mode='IP_V6_PREFERRED'), auto_bind='NO_TLS', version=3, authentication='ANONYMOUS', client_strategy='SYNC', auto_referrals=True, check_names=True, read_only=False, lazy=False, raise_exceptions=False, fast_decoder=True, auto_range=True, return_empty_attributes=True, auto_encode=True, auto_escape=True, use_referral_cache=False)
>>>
```

I want you to know that there are four connection strategies: `SYNC`, `ASYNC`, `RESTARTABLE`, and `REUSABLE`. In our case, we're using SYNC, as indicated in the `conn` result with `client_strategy='SYN'C`. This is the default strategy, which means the client waits for the server's response before proceeding with further operations.


also we Prints information about the Server object, showing details like host, port, and SSL usage the same way we do with connection :

```bash
>>> srv
Server(host='emsec.emsec.htb', port=389, use_ssl=False, allowed_referral_hosts=[('*', True)], get_info='SCHEMA', mode='IP_V6_PREFERRED')
```



```bash
>>> print(conn)
ldap://emsec.emsec.htb:389 - cleartext - user: None - not lazy - bound - open - <local: 10.10.10.40:53937 - remote: 10.10.10.10:389> - tls not started - listening - SyncStrategy - internal 
decoder
>>>
```

From the `print(conn)` result, we observed that it's a `cleartext` connection, which is the type the server is currently listening to. We'll explore how to switch to SSL and how to use secure ldap later.

### Getting Information from the server (Anonymous Bind):

I should note that we are currently in an `Anonymous Bind`, attempting to gather information from the server.

but first we need to specify the `get_info=ALL` parameter indicates that when establishing a connection, the client should request all available information about the LDAP server.

also the` auto_bind=True` which indicates that the connection should be automatically established upon creation.


```python
>>> server = Server('emsec.emsec.htb',  get_info=ALL)
>>> conn = Connection(server, auto_bind=True)
>>> server.info

With `server.info`, we successfully retrieved information about the LDAP server using the `info` attribute of the Server object. However, our result is limited since we are binding as anonymous. We'll find more useful information with Simple Password Bind and SASL Bind.


## Simple Password :

Simply put, with a `Simple Password Bind`, you provide a DN (Distinguished Name) and a password. The server then checks the validity of the credentials and either permits or denies access to the elements of the  DIT (Directory Information Tree). On the other hand, for `SASL Bind`, we use an external certificate or a Kerberos ticket to identify the user.


***Note : 
The `Directory Information Tree (DIT)` is a hierarchical tree structure that organizes entries within a directory server. It is a fundamental concept in LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) and represents the organization of directory entries.***

Here's an example of the syntax for a DIT:

```bash
cn=John Doe,ou=Users,dc=emsec,dc=htb

```

## Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) :

SASL is a framework for authentication, it allows client and server to negotiate an authentication method among those supported. SASL authentication adds 4 authentication subtypes:

![SALS Methods auth](/assets/img/posts/addc-ldap3/SASL_ldap3.drawio.png)

* `GSS-SPNEGO` : Simple and Protected `GSSAPI` Negotiation Mechanism, yet another protocol to negotiate authentication. Active Directory provides `NTLM` or `Kerberos` as underlaying methods.

* `GSSAPI` : Kerberos (GSSAPI is often used with Kerberos, a widely used authentication protocol that provides strong authentication and security features.)

* `EXTERNAL` : SASL EXTERNAL is a Simple Authentication and Security Layer mechanism that enables a client to authenticate itself to a server using credentials provided by the underlying transport layer, such as `SSL/TLS` certificates.

* `DIGEST-MD5` : Challenge-response authentication with message digest algorithm.

### Logging into the server :



```python
>>> from ldap3 import Server, Connection, ALL
>>> server = Server('emsec.emsec.htb', get_info=ALL)
>>> conn = Connection(server, 'user4', 'Password@123!', auto_bind=True)
>>> conn.extend.standard.who_am_i()
'u:EMSEC0\\user4'
>>>
```



we checks that we are a valid user using `who_am_i()` and this extended operation returns our identity `u:EMSEC0\\user4`


***Note: if you get empty response from `conn.extend.standard.who_am_i() .`This means you have no authentication status on the server, so you are an anonymous user.***

## Establishing a secure connection :

Previously, we used `print(conn)` to view the details of our connection, and it showed `cleartext` ,This means that credentials pass unencrypted over the wire (insecure LDAP: port 389). Also this raises concerns about the potential for password capture by anyone in the same network using tools like `Wireshark`, Such as shown below.

![not secure connection ldap](/assets/img/posts/addc-ldap3/not_secure_ldap.png)


The LDAP protocol provides two ways to secure a connection: `LDAP over TLS` and the `StartTLS` extended operation. Both methods establish a secure TLS connection: the former secure with TLS the communication channel as soon as the connection is open, while the latter can be used at any time on an already open unsecure connection to secure it issuing the StartTLS operation.

```bash
>>> from ldap3 import Server, Connection, ALL
>>> server  = Server("emsec.emsec.htb",use_ssl=True,get_info=ALL)
>>> conn = Connection(server, 'user4','Password@123!', auto_bind=True)
>>> tls_result = conn.start_tls()
>>> print(conn)
ldaps://emsec.emsec.htb:636 - ssl - user: user4 - not lazy - bound - open - <local: 10.10.10.40:43075 - remote: 10.10.10.10:636> - tls not started - listening - SyncStrategy - internal decoder
```

Now, upon checking with `print(conn)`, we observe `ssl` instead of `cleartext`, indicating that we are now using a secure connection. However, TLS hasn't started. This is because we haven't specified any TLS options, and thus, there is no checking of certificate validity. To customize TLS behavior, you can provide a Tls object to the Server object ([ldap3.Tls](https://programtalk.com/python-more-examples/ldap3.Tls/) )


Now with encrypted connections (SSL) a network sniffer can't capture passwords or any other sensitive data:

![ssl ldap](/assets/img/posts/addc-ldap3/ldap_ssl.png)


## Searching for Users and Groups :

uppose we need to enumerate LDAP using the ldap3 library. Before we begi  n, it's important to note that to find entries in the DIT, you must use the Search operation. However, there are two mandatory parameters for the search operation: `search_base` which denotes the location in the DIT where the search will start, and `search_filter` a string that describes what you are searching for

### Dump All Users :

```python
>>> from ldap3 import Server, Connection, ALL
>>> conn = Connection(server, 'user4', 'Password@123!', auto_bind=True)
>>> conn.search('dc=emsec,dc=htb', '(objectclass=person)')
True
>>> conn.entries
```

![dump users](/assets/img/posts/addc-ldap3/search_for_users.png)

Here, we are requesting all entries of the class `person`. This will display all users on our Windows server.

This operation is looking for entries in the LDAP directory that match the specified search criteria

```bash
conn.search('dc=emsec,dc=emsec,dc=htb', '(objectclass=person)')
```

`dc=emsec,dc=emsec,dc=htb` : This specifies the starting point in the LDAP directory tree for the search.

`(objectclass=person)` : This filter defines the conditions that entries must meet to be considered a match. In this case, it's looking for entries with the objectClass attribute set to person.


### Dump All Groups :

To dump users, we can simply change the filter from `'(objectclass=person)'` to `'(objectclass=group)'` This modification will retrieve all groups in the domain.

```python
>>> conn.search('dc=emsec,dc=htb', '(objectclass=groups)')
True
>>> conn.entries

You can dump every object using various filters.

[LDAP Search Filter Cheatsheet](https://jonlabelle.com/snippets/view/markdown/ldap-search-filter-cheatsheet)


## Adding Users and Groups :

To `add` or `modify` Users, groups or Organizational Unit one must have administrator privileges or the necessary permissions. I have already granted `user4` the permission to add users and groups.


To clarify the permissions granted to `user4`, I have given them full control over the `LDAP3_OU`:

![user4 permission](/assets/img/posts/addc-ldap3/user4_permission.png)


### Add new user to organizational unit :

To search for all OU's that it in the domain we use this filter : 

```bash
>>>conn.search('dc=emsec,dc=htb','(objectclass=organizationalUnit)')
True
>>> conn.entries
[DN: OU=Domain Controllers,DC=emsec,DC=htb - STATUS: Read - READ TIME: 2024-01-14T20:36:46.101068
, DN: OU=XXX,DC=emsec,DC=htb - STATUS: Read - READ TIME: 2024-01-14T20:36:46.101115
, DN: OU=XXX,DC=emsec,DC=htb - STATUS: Read - READ TIME: 2024-01-14T20:36:46.101142
, DN: OU=LDAP3_OU,DC=emsec,DC=htb - STATUS: Read - READ TIME: 2024-01-14T20:36:46.101167
]
```

Now Let’s try to add users to LDAP3_OU 

```python
>>> from ldap3 import Server,Connection,ALL
>>> server = Server('emsec.emsec.htb')
>>> conn = Connection(server,'user4','Password@123!',auto_bind=True)
>>> conn.add('cn=Test_user,ou=LDAP3_OU,dc=emsec,dc=htb', 'user', {'givenName': 'TestName', 'sn': 'Test', 'departmentNumber': 'Test', 'telephoneNumber': 1111})
True
>>> conn.result
{'result': 0, 'description': 'success', 'dn': '', 'message': '', 'referrals': None, 'type': 'addResponse'}
>>>
```

As you can see, we have successfully added 'Test_user' to the 'LDAP3_OU' Organizational Unit. This occurred because we have full control permission over the OU.

![add user to ou](/assets/img/posts/addc-ldap3/add_user_to_ou.png)


***Note:When creating a user, you can specify additional attributes such as description, mail, and more. We will explore this further in the modify entry section***


### Add group to organizational unit :

As we saw earlier, to convert an entry from a user to a group, we simply need to change the `objectClass` attribute from `user` to `group`

```python
>>> conn.add('cn=Test_Group,ou=LDAP3_OU,dc=emsec,dc=htb', 'group', {'cn': 'Test_Group','description': 'Test Group'})
True
>>> conn.result
{'result': 0, 'description': 'success', 'dn': '', 'message': '', 'referrals': None, 'type': 'addResponse'}
>>> 
```

### Add user to group :

As an administrator, I have granted user4 permission to add users to the `Test_Group`. This means we can accomplish this task using only user4.


## Rename,Modify,Update an entry :

Make sure to import the necessary namespaces MODIFY_ADD, MODIFY_REPLACE, and MODIFY_DELETE. With these imported, you can then modify, rename, and update an entry as needed.

```python
>>> from ldap3 import MODIFY_ADD, MODIFY_REPLACE, MODIFY_DELETE
```

### Rename an entry :

Renaming an entry in LDAP means changing its `RDN (Relative Distinguished Name)`

```python
>>> conn.modify_dn('cn=Test_user,ou=LDAP3_OU,dc=emsec,dc=htb', 'cn=Renamed_User')
True
>>> conn.result
{'result': 0, 'description': 'success', 'dn': '', 'message': '', 'referrals': None, 'type': 'modDNResponse'}
>>>
```

### Update an entry :

In this section, we will change attributes such as mail, description, and more. To do this, make sure to import the necessary namespaces `MODIFY_ADD`, `MODIFY_REPLACE`, and `MODIFY_DELETE`, as mentioned previously. Now, let's proceed to update the attributes of our user `Renamed_user`."

```python
>>> conn.modify('cn=Renamed_User,ou=LDAP3_OU,dc=emsec,dc=htb', {'sn': [(MODIFY_REPLACE, ['New_Value'])]})
True
```

To delete the updated value :

```python
>>> conn.modify('cn=Renamed_User,ou=LDAP3_OU,dc=emsec,dc=htb', {'sn': [(MODIFY_DELETE, ['New_Value'])]})
True
```

We have successfully deleted the `sn` attribute of our user



## Building my Tool NexusAD :

The NexusAD tool, available on GitHub, is designed to simplify Active Directory management tasks. While the tool covers a range of functionalities, I want to emphasize that it's created solely for fun and learning. In this blog post, I'll share some screenshots of the tool in action. The code is open for exploration and modification. Feel free to upgrade and customize the tool based on your needs. Let's run the tool and have some fun with Active Directory management!

You can find the complete source code on [nexusAD.py](https://github.com/Mostafatoumi/nexusAd/blob/main/nexusAD.py)

### How to use this simple tool ?

Simply run the command `python3 nexusAD.py -h` to see the available functionalities of this tool :


```bash
